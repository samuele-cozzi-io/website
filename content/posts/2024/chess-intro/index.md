Chess is a two-player strategy board game that requires skill, critical thinking, and analytical reasoning. The game involves moving pieces on a square board with the ultimate objective of capturing the opponent's King.

The game of chess originated in ancient India over 1500 years ago and has since spread to become one of the most popular games globally. A standard chess set consists of 32 pieces per player: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.

Players take turns moving their pieces according to specific rules and constraints. The game requires a deep understanding of tactics, strategy, and psychological manipulation as players aim to outmaneuver each other.

## Rules

The rules of chess are published by [FIDE](https://handbook.fide.com/chapter/E012023) (Fédération Internationale des Échecs; "International Chess Federation"), chess's world governing body, in its Handbook.
