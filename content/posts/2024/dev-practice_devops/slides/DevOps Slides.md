# Application Lifecycle

DevOps influences the application lifecycle throughout its phases:

- plan 
- develop 
- deliver
- operate

In a true DevOps culture, each role is involved in each phase to some extent.

# Culture

While adopting DevOps practices automates and optimizes processes through technology, it all starts with the culture inside the organization- and the people who play a part in it. The challenge of cultivating a DevOps culture requires deep changes in the way people work and collaborate.

- Collaboration, visibility, and alignment
- Shifts in scope and accountability
- Shorter release cycles
- Continuous learning
