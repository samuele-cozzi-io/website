I built my personal blog **Samuele‚Äôs Space** using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator, combined with the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) theme for modern styling. My goal was a fast, lightweight, and easily maintainable blog with a sleek design and minimal effort to deploy ‚Äì and Hugo delivered exactly that.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Hugo Works & Why I Chose It

Hugo is a static site generator, which means it takes **Markdown files** (like blog posts), applies templates and themes, and turns them into static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. There‚Äôs no server-side rendering or database ‚Äî just fast, secure, and simple files ready to host anywhere.

### Key Benefits of Hugo:

* **Markdown-first**: Content is written in plain `.md` files with front matter (metadata like title, date, tags).
* **Themes & templating**: Easily apply themes (like Blowfish) that handle the layout, styling, and behavior.
* **Blazing fast builds**: Hugo can rebuild hundreds of pages in milliseconds.
* **No backend required**: All output is static, so you can host it on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static file server.
* **Built-in features**: Hugo includes things like taxonomy (categories/tags), table of contents, image processing, and more ‚Äî no plugins needed.

## üê° Why I Chose the Blowfish Theme

[Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) is a powerful and minimal Hugo theme designed with developers and writers in mind. I chose it because it gave me:

* A clean, modern aesthetic out of the box
* Excellent mobile responsiveness
* Extensive configuration options without touching any CSS
* First-class support for features like:

  * Search
  * Code highlighting with copy buttons
  * Light/dark mode with auto-detect
  * Table of contents, reading time, and "Zen mode"
  * Custom backgrounds and hero sections

It also supports multiple homepage layouts (`hero`, `background`, `card`, etc.) and article header styles (e.g. big, background, thumbnail). These can all be customized via the `params.toml` configuration file ‚Äî no hacking into templates or overriding theme files needed.

What I especially appreciate is that Blowfish offers a polished user experience but remains extremely lightweight. It prioritizes performance and accessibility while letting me personalize everything through simple TOML settings.

## üß™ Customizing Blowfish with `params.toml`

The heart of the customization is the `params.toml` file. This file defines how the site should behave and look.

### Color & Appearance

```toml
colorScheme = "fire"
defaultAppearance = "light"
autoSwitchAppearance = true
enableSearch = true
enableCodeCopy = true
```

This sets a ‚Äúfire‚Äù color palette, enables light/dark mode switching, and turns on features like code snippet copying and search.

### Homepage Design

```toml
[homepage]
layout = "background"
showRecent = true
showRecentItems = 3
layoutBackgroundBlur = true
```

This creates a homepage with a blurred background image and recent blog post cards.

### Article Page Configuration

```toml
[article]
showDate = true
showAuthor = true
showReadingTime = true
showTableOfContents = true
showZenMode = true
```

These options make blog posts readable and accessible, with TOC, reading time, and Zen Mode for distraction-free reading.

## üñº Using BGJar for Background Art

One unique touch is the animated SVG background on my homepage. I used [BGJar](https://bgjar.com), a free online SVG generator. You pick a style, customize colors and shapes, and export it.

I used the ‚ÄúAnimated Shape‚Äù pattern and configured it in my `params.toml`:

```toml
defaultBackgroundImage = "imgs/Animated Shape(2).svg"
```

This adds a playful yet subtle motion to the page, especially when blurred by the homepage layout.

## üíª Hosting with GitHub & Deploying via GitHub Actions

My entire blog lives in this GitHub repository:
üîó [github.com/samuele-cozzi-io/website](https://github.com/samuele-cozzi-io/website)

Every time I push to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions rebuilds and deploys the site using this workflow:

```yaml

name: Deploy Hugo site to Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches:
      - main

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

# Default to bash
defaults:
  run:
    shell: bash

jobs:
  # Build job
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      HUGO_VERSION: 0.143.1
    steps:
      - name: Install Hugo CLI
        run: |
          wget -O ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo.deb https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v${HUGO_VERSION}/hugo_extended_${HUGO_VERSION}_linux-amd64.deb \
          && sudo dpkg -i ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo.deb          
      - name: Install Dart Sass
        run: sudo snap install dart-sass
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          submodules: recursive
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Setup Pages
        id: pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
      - name: Install Node.js dependencies
        run: "[[ -f package-lock.json || -f npm-shrinkwrap.json ]] && npm ci || true"
      - name: Build with Hugo
        env:
          # For maximum backward compatibility with Hugo modules
          HUGO_ENVIRONMENT: production
          HUGO_ENV: production
        run: |
          hugo \
            --gc \
            --minify \
            --baseURL "${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_url }}/"          
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./public

  # Deployment job
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4

```

This builds the site into the `public/` directory and publishes it to the `gh-pages` branch, which GitHub Pages serves from.

üöÄ Just push changes ‚Äî Hugo does the rest.

## üèÅ Final Thoughts

Hugo + Blowfish + GitHub Pages is a dream stack for technical blogs:

* It‚Äôs fast.
* It‚Äôs version-controlled.
* It‚Äôs customizable.
* It‚Äôs zero-cost to host.

With just Markdown files, a theme, and a bit of SVG magic, I‚Äôve built a fully-featured blog I‚Äôm proud of. If you‚Äôre curious to explore, check out:
