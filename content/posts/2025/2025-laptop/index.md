Setting up a brand new laptop is one of my favorite rituals as a developer. It’s like moving into a new apartment — everything is clean, minimal, and full of possibilities. This time in 2025, I decided to document every tool, app, and extension I installed — partly so I can repeat it in the future, partly so I can share it with anyone building their own developer machine.

## 🌐 Browsers

A good browser is more than a window to the internet — it’s a workspace.  
I use browsers for development, research, and productivity, so they need to be fast, customizable, and privacy-friendly.

### Firefox

[**Firefox**](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) #linux #windows #macos

This is my daily driver. Open-source, privacy-focused, and with extension support that’s second to none. Plus, it looks great when customized.

#### 🔌 Browser Extensions

**Tools**
- [**AdBlocker Ultimate**](https://adblockultimate.net/) #firefox – Keeps my web pages clean and clutter-free. No exceptions, no whitelists.  
- [**Enpass**](https://www.enpass.io/) #linux #windows #macos #android – My password vault. I like it because I control where the data lives — cloud, WebDAV, or offline.

**Productivity**
- [**Raindrop.io**](http://Raindrop.io) #android #web – My bookmark brain. Neat collections, tags, and sync across devices.  
- [**Karakeep**](https://karakeep.app/) #android #web – My self-hosted “read-it-later” list.  
- [**Todoist**](https://todoist.com/home) #android #web – Keeps my tasks in check, both work and personal.  
- [**Firefox Multi-Account Containers**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/) #firefox – A life-saver for juggling multiple logins without switching browsers.

#### 📑 Firefox Sidebar

Firefox now comes with a built-in sidebar, so I don’t bother with vertical tab extensions anymore. It’s perfect for quickly flipping between tabs, bookmarks, and even AI chats.
